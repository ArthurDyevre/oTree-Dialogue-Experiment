                <strong>Basic Idea</strong>
                <br>
                In this task you will face {{ n }} decisions displayed on your screen. For each decision you have to choose "Option A" or "Option B".
                While the payoff of Option B is fixed for all decisions, the payoff of Option A for each option will vary.
                You will be informed about your payoff at the end of the experiment.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After you have made all of your choices, one of the {{ n }} decisions will be randomly chosen for
                your payment. If you chose "Option A" for that decision, it will be randomly determined
                (according to the corresponding probabilities) whether the low or high outcome will constitute your payoff.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong> Summary </strong>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                - You will make {{ n }} decisions
                <br/>
                - For each decision you will have to choose between "Option A" and "Option B". You may choose A for some decision rows and B for other rows.
                <br/>
                - When you are done with the task, one of the {{ n }} decisions will be randomly picked for your payoff.
                <br/>
                - If you chose "Option A" then the computer will randomly determine the low or high payoff.
                <br/>
                <br/>
