                You will participate in 3 decision games and the first two games will assess your aversion to risk. The
                last game will be a two player game competing over judicial resources.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                During decision game 3 you participate as either player 1 representing an international court or player 2
                representing a domestic court.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                After finishing the game you can see you payments after a short questionaire.
